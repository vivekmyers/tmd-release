Code for the paper "[Offline Goal Conditioned Reinforcement Learning with Temporal Distance
Representations](https://tmd-website.github.io/static/pdf/tmd.pdf)".

This repository is a fork of [OGBench](https://github.com/seohongpark/ogbench). We add an
implementation of the new Temporal Metric Distillation (TMD) algorithm, as well as a baseline
implementation of [Conservative Metric Distillation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.17098) (CMD).
